# RbasicStats
The core of this tutorial is built around the Jupyter Notebooks, an interactive computational environment run in a web browser.

In this particular case we will be using the R programming language for the data exploration/analysis.

Before starting you need to visit the #Getting Started# section (developed by Tania Allard):
